/*3.12 (Modified Account Class) Modify class Account (Fig. 3.13) to provide a method called debit
that withdraws money from an Account. Ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the
Accountâ€™s balance. If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the method should print a
message indicating "Debit amount exceeded account balance." Modify class AccountTest
(Fig. 3.14) to test method debit.*/
