/*5.18 (Modified Compound-Interest Program)
Modify the application in Fig. 5.6 to use only integers to calculate the compound interest.
[Hint: Treat all monetary amounts as integral numbers of pennies. Then break the result
into its dollars and cents portions by using the division and remainder operations,
respectively. Insert a period between the dollars and the cents portions.]*/
