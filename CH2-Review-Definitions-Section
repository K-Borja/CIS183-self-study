//CHAPTER 2 SELF STUDY ANSWERS
//REVIEW/DEFINITIONS SECTION

2.1 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
	a) A(n) _____ begins the body of every method, and a(n) _____ ends the body of every method.
		= Left Bracket, Right Bracket 
	b) The _____ statement is used to make decisions.
		= if
	c) _____ begins an end-of-line comment.
		= //
	d) _____, _____ and _____ are called white space.
		= new line, space character, tab
	e) _____ are reserved for use by Java.
		= keyword
	f) Java applications begin execution at method _____ .
		= main
	g) Methods _____, _____ and _____ display information in a command window.
		= System.out.print(), System.out.println(), System.out.printf()
	
2.2 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
	a) Comments cause the computer to print the text after the // on the screen when the program executes.
		= false. Comments are for documentation and program's readability
	b) All variables must be given a type when theyâ€™re declared.
		= true. 
	c) Java considers the variables number and NuMbEr to be identical.
		= false. Java is case sensitive.
	d) The remainder operator (%) can be used only with integer operands.
		= false. The remainder can also be used for non integers.
	e) The arithmetic operators *, /, %, + and - all have the same level of precedence.
		= false. *, /, % have higher precedence than +,-.
	
2.3 Write statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:
	a) Declare variables c, thisIsAVariable, q76354 and number to be of type int.
		
		int c;
		int thisIsAVariable;
		int q78354;
		int number;		
		
	b) Prompt the user to enter an integer.
		
		System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
	
	c) Input an integer and assign the result to int variable value. Assume Scanner variable input can be used to read a value from the keyboard.
	
		Assume: Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
				System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
				
		int value = input.nextInt();
	
	d) Print "This is a Java program" on one line in the command window. Use method System.out.println.
	
		System.out.println("This is a Java program");
	
	e) Print "This is a Java program" on two lines in the command window. The first line should end with Java. Use method System.out.println.
	
		System.out.println("This is a Java\nprogram");
	
	f) Print "This is a Java program" on two lines in the command window. The first line should end with Java. Use method System.out.printf and two %s format specifiers.
	
		System.out.printf("%s\n%s\n", "This is a Java", "program");
	
	g) If the variable number is not equal to 7, display "The variable number is not equal to 7".
	
		if(number != 7)
			System.out.println("The variable number is not equal to 7.");

2.4 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements:
	a) if ( c < 7 );
		System.out.println( "c is less than 7" );
		
		== remove first semicolon
		== if( c < 7 )
		
	b) if ( c => 7 )
		System.out.println( "c is equal to or greater than 7" );

		== > should come before =
		== if ( c >= 7 )
		
2.5 Write declarations, statements or comments that accomplish each of the following tasks:
	a) State that a program will calculate the product of three integers.
	
		//program will calculate product of three integers
	
	b) Create a Scanner called input that reads values from the standard input.
		
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		
	c) Declare the variables x, y, z and result to be of type int.
		
		int x;
		int y;
		int z;
		int result;
		
	d) Prompt the user to enter the first integer.
		
		System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
		
	e) Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable x.
		
		x = input.nextInt();
		
	f) Prompt the user to enter the second integer.
		
		System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
		
	g) Read the second integer from the user and store it in the variable y.
		
		y = input.nextInt();
		
	h) Prompt the user to enter the third integer.
		
		System.out.print("Enter the third integer: ");
		
	i) Read the third integer from the user and store it in the variable z.
		
		z = input.nextInt();
		
	j) Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign the result to the variable result.
		
		result = x * y * z;
		
	k) Display the message "Product is" followed by the value of the variable result.
		
		System.out.printf("Product is %d\n", result);
		

2.6 Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 2.5, write a complete program that calculates and prints the product of three integers.

	//program will calculate product of three integers
	import java.util.Scanner;
	
	public class ch2ex2p6
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			int x;
			int y;
			int z;
			int result;
			
			System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
			x = input.nextInt();
			
			System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
			y = input.nextInt();
			
			System.out.print("Enter the third integer: ");
			z = input.nextInt();
			
			result = x * y * z;
			System.out.printf("Product is %d\n", result);
		}
	}
