//chapter 2 Program section

2.15 (Arithmetic) Write an application that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains them
from the user and prints their sum, product, difference and quotient (division). Use the techniques
shown in Fig. 2.7
	
	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class arithmetic
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int sum;
			int product;
			int difference;
			double quotient;
			
			Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.print("Enter first integer: ");
			int num1 = keyboard.nextInt();
			
			System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");
			int num2 = keyboard.nextInt();
			
			sum = num1 + num2;
			product = num1 * num2;
			difference = num1 - num2;
			quotient = num1/num2;
			
			System.out.printf("sum = %d\nproduct = %d\ndifference = %d\nquotient = %.2f\n", sum, product, difference, quotient);
		
		}
	}
	
2.17 (Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) Write an application that inputs three integers from the
user and displays the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of the numbers. Use the techniques
shown in Fig. 2.15. [Note: The calculation of the average in this exercise should result in an integer
representation of the average. So, if the sum of the values is 7, the average should be 2, not
2.3333â€¦.]

	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class SmallLarge
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.print("Enter first integer: ");
			int first = input.nextInt();
			
			System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");
			int second = input.nextInt();
			
			System.out.print("Enter third integer: ");
			int third = input.nextInt();
			
			int sum = first + second + third;
			System.out.println("sum = "+sum);
			int product = first + second + third;
			System.out.println("product = "+product);
			int average = product / 3;
			System.out.println("average = "+average);
			
			int smallest = first;
			if(second < smallest)
				smallest = second;
			if(third < smallest)
				smallest = third;
			System.out.println("Smallest = "+smallest);
				
			int largest = first;
			if(second > largest)
				largest = second;
			if(third > largest)
				largest = third;
			System.out.println("Largest = "+largest);

		}
	}
	
2.31 (Table of Squares and Cubes) Using only the programming techniques you learned in this chapter, write an application that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and prints the resulting values in table format, as shown below. [Note: This program does not require any input from the user.]
	
	public class SquaresCubes
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int square;
			int cube;
			System.out.printf("%s%10s%10s\n","number","square","cube");
			for(int num=0; num <=10; num++)
			{
				square = num*num;
				cube = square*num;
				System.out.printf("%d%11d%11d\n", num, square,cube);
			}
		}
	}
