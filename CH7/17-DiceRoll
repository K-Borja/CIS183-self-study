/*7.17(Dice Rolling)
Write an application to simulate the rolling of two dice. The application
should use an object of class Random once to roll the first die and again
to roll the second die. The sum of the two values should then be calculated.
Each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6, so the sum of the values will
vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum, and 2 and 12 the
least frequent. Figure 7.28 shows the 36 possible combinations of the two dice.
Your application should roll the dice 36,000,000 times. Use a one-dimensional array
to tally the number of times each possible sum appears.
Display the results in tabular format.*/
